kinectlightpainting v 0.0
===================


A Kinect and a screen monitor (a computer) will be the basic input and output devices for this application. As a basic set up, the Kinect will be placed at the same level of the user so the whole body movement of the user can be captured, while the screen monitor would be placed over the Kinect at the eye-level of the user so the user can have a better visual feedback.
We are using Processing to visualise our application because it is a fast and easy to use illustration tool. In order to use Processing and Kinect together, the OpenNI SDK [8] appears to be a better choice because they have SimpleOpenNI as a wrapping library to support Processing. Also, the OpenNI SDK works well for both Windows and MacOS platforms.
